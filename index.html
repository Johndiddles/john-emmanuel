              <span>1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
              University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known
              as the "National Youth Administration"

              <span>1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money.
              Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
              Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this
              left scars on me."

            <li>
              <span>1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
              laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
              returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
              breeding pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
              Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked
              his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
              disinfectants, and other applied science.

            <li>

              - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology

            <li>
              <span>1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
              leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new
              plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
              6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including
              different varieties for each major climate on Earth.

            <li>
              <span>1945</span>

              yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1953</span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
              with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that
              responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's
              wheat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1962</span>
              - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to
              the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation
              due to a rapidly expanding population
